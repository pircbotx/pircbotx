This is a list of all the changes from PircBot. This list excludes any changes to already rewritten code.

-Input and Output has been refactored for a better flow. Origional: Bot -> InputThread(due to it holding the writer for some reason) -> OutputThread. New: Bot -> OutputThread. As a result, removed InputThread.sendRawLine, changed OutputThread.sendRawLine to public (old: package static)
-Removed the custom Queue, replaced by LinkedBlockingQueue in OutputThread
-Removed sendRawLine from PircBot. 
-Can now set socket timeout
-If bot is already connected and connect is called again, throw a IrcException instead of a IOException
-Minor: Removed InputThread.dispose(), replaced by simply closing the socket and letting the thread exit after the loop
-Minor: All imports are now using full path vs wildcard matching
-Basic utility class created, might be useful
-Channel object created, holds users and other information
-PircBot.getChannels() returns Channel objects in a list, while getChannelsNames returnes channel names in a list. Same for getUsers and getUsersNames
-Removed redundant equals and hashCode methods
-PircBot._channels is now a synchronized map
-User object greatly extended
-Server info written but not used
